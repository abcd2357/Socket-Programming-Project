1. Name: Kangyan Xu
2. ID: 998
3. Tasks done in the assignment:
   Read "Beej's Guide to Network Programming" chapter 5,6 to learn how to do socket programming.
   Using C to code and realize all three phases required in the project.

4. Code Files & their functions:
   1) Makefile:
      For running the project.
   2) client.c：
      Read the input (Map ID, Starting Node ID, File Size), connect AWS, send inputs and
      receive the results from AWS via TCP.
   3) aws.c:
      Communicate with serverA and serverB via UDP.
      Send Map ID and Starting Node ID to serverA and receive the shortest path lengths to other nodes.
      Send shortest path lengths, File Size, Propagation Speed, Transmission Speed to ServerB and receive delays.
   4）serverA.c:
      Construct the map, "struct" is used here, different node IDs are detected and sorted (by Index).
      Dijkstra Algorithm is performed to find the shortest paths.
   5) serverB.c:
      Calculate the Transmission Delay, Propagation Delay and End-to-end Delay for all the shortest paths.

5. The format of all the messages exchanged:
   1) Client --> AWS:
      Char array Map_ID[1]
      integer Source_Vertex_Index
      integer File_Size
   2) AWS --> Server A:
      Char array Map_ID[1]
      integer Source_Vertex_Index
   3) Server A --> AWS:
      integer size (Number of nodes in the corresponding map)
      integer array path[2*size] (Destination IDs, corresponding shortest lengths)
      double SpeedP (Corresponding Propagation Speed)
      double SpeedT (Corresponding Transmission Speed)
   4) AWS --> ServerB:
      integer File_Size
      integer size
      integer array path[2*size]
      double SpeedP
      double SpeedT
   5) ServerB --> AWS:
      double array delay[size] (Corresponding End-to-end Delays for each Destination)
      double array Tp[size] (Corresponding Propagation Delays for each Destination)
      double array Tt[size] (Corresponding Transmission Delays for each Destination)
   6) AWS --> Client:
      double array result[226] (Number of nodes (integer size), Destination IDs, Min Lengths, Tts, Tps, Delays)

6. Idiosyncrasy of this project:
   Structs and arrays are widely used.
   Less than 10 maps in the map.txt is acceptable.
   Node ID (aka Vertex Index) less than 40000 is acceptable.

7. Reused Code:
   Socket parts: "Beej's Guide to Network Programming" is referenced, mainly demo codes in chapter 6.
   Dijkstra parts: Website (https://www.cnblogs.com/skywang12345/p/3711512.html) is referenced.
   The structure of codes is cleraly indicated in the C files.
